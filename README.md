# Milieu_Sensors
This an attempt to rewrite the Luftdaten software into a class for each different sensor.

In the first version only the SDS011 sensor is supported.
This program becomes interesting as soon as the second sensor is added, that's the moment I'll get into contact with the orginal designers.
